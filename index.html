                        Hi, my name is Owen Chanthala. I lived and studied in San Diego, California. I love
                        sports, arts, anime, and fashion. Concerning sports, my favorite teams are the Chargers,
                        Lakers, and Padres. No offense to my new home but, like my cousins, whom I am living
                        with, we dislike all Seattle teams and don't care about the Seahawks. Anyways, I enjoy
                        going to art museums. Observing famous and local artists. With the arts, I am very fond
                        the artwork and creativity of anime and fashion. From vintage, current trends and high
                        end. Before coming to Seattle, I would sell various items from my closet, that I either
                        purchased at some point or thrifted somewhere.
                    </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>
                        Back home I was studying computer science and working on code myself. I moved out to
                        Seattle at the end of October, living in Lacey, which is about an hour away from the
                        city, depending on traffic. I moved here to attend the coding boot camp and possibly
                        find a career out here. I can dream, but soon, I would like to work for Microsoft. If
                        that doesn't pan out right away, I wouldn't mind finding a local tech company to pursue
                        my work in coding.
